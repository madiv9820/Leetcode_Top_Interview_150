### 📝 How to Use

1. Navigate to the topic folder (e.g., arrays/, strings/).
2. Choose the difficulty subfolder (easy_breezy/, medium_mystery/, hard_headache/).

### 💡 Coding Guidelines
- Solutions are implemented in **Python 3**.
- Each function is **self-contained** with proper docstrings.
- Arrays, strings, and other inputs are handled **in-place** where required.
- Time and space complexity is **commented** at the top of each solution.
- Edge cases and constraints are handled according to the problem description.
